## Usage
```
$ docker pull bardiir/auto-caesium
$ docker run -v /path/to/your/image/files:/caesium bardiir/auto-caesium
```
`docker pull bardiir/auto-caesium` does update the instance image. Â 
`docker run...` will mount the folder `/path/to/your/image/files` into the docker image and convert all files within that folder replacing image files with optimized versions and leaving everything that cannot be optimized without errors as is.

## ToDo
- Don't optimize already optimized images again

## Disclaimer / Warning

The software used in this container is far from beeing stable. As this container does replace files inline make sure to keep a backup of all files at any time prior to using this as this can corrupt data and cause potential data loss on everything it is used on!
